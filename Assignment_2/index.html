            <p> Peter Benjamin Parker is the secret identity of Spider-Man. At first, Peter was portrayed as a teenage high school student who, following the deaths of his parents, Richard and Mary Parker, in a plane crash, was raised as an orphan in New York City by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben. In addition to giving him a plethora of supporting characters, including Flash Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson, and Harry Osborn; romantic interests, like Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and the Black Cat; and enemies, like the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, and Venom, Lee and Ditko forced the character to deal with the hardships of adolescence and financial difficulties. In the tale of his creation, a radioactive spider bite gives Spider-Man incredible strength and skills. Superhuman strength, dexterity, reflexes, endurance, durability, coordination, and balance, hanging to walls and ceilings like a spider, and using his "spider-sense" precognition to sense danger. He constructs "web-shooter" wrist-mounted gadgets that fire custom-designed fake spider webs, which he uses for both fighting and citywide web-swinging. After his Uncle Ben was slain by a robber that Peter was powerless to stop, Peter Parker decided to utilize his abilities to fight crime by transforming into Spider-Man. Initially, Peter Parker used his skills for his own personal benefit.</p>
