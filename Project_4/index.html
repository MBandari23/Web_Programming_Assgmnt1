                        Marvel Comics publishes American comic books featuring the superhero The Hulk. The Incredible Hulk's May 1962 debut included the character, who was created by writer Stan Lee and illustrator Jack Kirby. The character, who suffers from dissociative identity disorder (DID), is mainly represented in his comic book appearances by his two alter egos, Dr. Robert Bruce Banner, a physically weak, socially reclusive, and emotionally reserved physicist, and Hulk, a green-skinned, hulking, muscular humanoid with limitless physical strength. Typically, these two alter egos are antagonistic to one another.
