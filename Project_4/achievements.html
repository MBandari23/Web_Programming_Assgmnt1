                        <p>One of the Hulk's most dangerous incarnations was the Immortal Hulk. During his travels, he discovered more about the history of the Hulk, including the One Below All's presence, other gamma-mutated people, and the Green Door's part in the Hulk's genesis. This would all culminate in a struggle for Bruce Banner's soul, which the Hulk would prevail in.
                            Since One Below All was the shadowy figure of the One Above All, its demise represents a significant accomplishment. The Hulk triumphed over an unparalleled destructive force in the universe and avoided a dreadful fate.</p>

                        <p>The Illuminati assumed responsibility for making the difficult decisions, yet their arrogance caused some horrible things to happen. It backfired to send the Hulk away from Earth since he held them accountable for the Sakaar's devastation. He made the unappealing decision to exact retribution on them.

                            He demolished Doctor Strange, smashed Mr. Fantastic, embarrassed Iron Man, and plowed through Black Bolt like he was nothing. The fact that he was able to dispatch four of Earth's most experienced heroes with so ease is a big problem, yet every hero who attempted to fight back against him was ultimately defeated until the Sentry intervened.</p>

                        <p>Though no one considers the Hulk to be a global leader, Planet Hulk managed to come into being. After Hulk unintentionally landed on Sakaar, he was reduced to a pit fighter and made to compete in the gladiator arenas owned by the Red King. Hulk formed bonds with other captives and eventually broke free to form a coalition that overthrew the Red King.
                            The Hulk's ability to organize a rebellion, diffuse tensions between rival factions, and generally outperform the heroes who brought him to Sakaar as a leader was startling. His leadership demonstrated that, given enough determination, the Hulk can accomplish anything.

                        <img src="https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Hulk-thunderclap-Red-Hulk.jpg" alt="section4">
                        <p>When the Red Hulk first appeared, there was much excitement surrounding his mystery as he defeated every evil and hero in his path. Even Thor, who was regarded as one of the most formidable creatures on the earth, was defeated by the wrath of this new antagonist. After his true identity as Thunderbolt Ross was made public, the Red Hulk ultimately lost to him in a fight.

                            Even though Red Hulk was the ideal opponent for the Hulk, the Hulk still prevailed. Even against an opponent designed just to defeat him, Hulk prevails. The Green Goliath's victory is all the more remarkable because no one else could vanquish the Red Hulk.</p>
